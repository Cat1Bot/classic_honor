# Classic Honor System

## Overview
This **Pengu Loader** plugin restores the classic honor system changes from patch 14.19. Say goodbye to honoring enemies (let's be real—it's often cringeworthy and, in my opinion, toxic). This plugin allows you to honor your teammates for reasons that are no longer available, effectively giving you more freedom to express your appreciation for your allies.

⚠️ **Note:** This plugin may become non-functional at any time if Riot removes the config flag or legacy components entirely.
