# Legacy Honor System
A plugin for Pengu Loader to revert the honor system changes in patch 14.19. No more honoring enemies (lets be real - its cringe and imo toxic). Yes this is kind of an exploit plugin since you can honor a teammate for reasons you normally cant do anymore. NOTE: this plugin may stop working at any time as Riot may remove the config flag or the legacy components all toghether.
